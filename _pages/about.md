Hi there! My name is **Yang Qin (秦阳)**. I'm a Ph.D. candidate (since 2021) at [the College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/e_jsjxy/), [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), fortunately advised by Prof. [**Dezhong Peng**](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1282/13563.htm) and Prof. [**Peng Hu**](https://penghu-cs.github.io/). I also collaborate closely with Prof. [**Xi Peng**](https://pengxi.me/) and Prof. [**Joey Tianyi Zhou**](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/).

My pursuits center on multimodal learning and large language models, with an emphasis on advancing robustness and cross-modal understanding in AI systems:

- Multimodal Learning 👀: Multimodal Fusion & Cross-modal Learning > Investigating multimodal fusion mechanisms and cross-modal representation learning paradigm to enable coherent integration of heterogeneous data sources;
- Robust Machine Learning 🦾: [Noisy Correspondence](https://github.com/QinYang79/Noisy-Correspondence-Summary) & Label in Multimodal Learning > Addressing challenges posed by noisy correspondence and labels in multimodal datasets, making efforts towards a unified noise-resilient multimodal learning framework;
- Large Language Models 🤖: [Code LLMs  & Application of MLLMs/LLMs](https://qinyang-cs.github.io/projects/LLMs) > Exploring open-generation (e.g., code) capabilities and multimodal extensions for real-world applications, including interactive learning and domain-specific knowledge adaptation.

If you are interested in collaborating with me or want to have a chat, please feel free to contact me via email (Any way you like).
