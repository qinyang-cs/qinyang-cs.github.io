Yang Qin (秦阳) is a Ph.D. candidate (since 2021) at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, advised by Prof. Dezhong Peng (彭德中). His current research interests mainly focus on multimodal learning and [noisy correspondence](https://github.com/QinYang79/Noisy-Correspondence-Summary) (NC). Recently, I am conducting research related to ***LLMs***.

- Multimodal Learning: Multimodal Fusion & Cross-modal Learning
- Noisy Correspondence: NCs in Image-Text Matching and Text-based ReID
- LLMs: Currently being  explored $\cdots$
