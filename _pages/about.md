<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Yang Qin (秦阳). I'm a Ph.D. candidate (since 2021) at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Dezhong Peng](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1182/7307.htm) and Prof. [Peng Hu](https://penghu-cs.github.io/). 

My research interests mainly focus on multimodal learning and [noisy correspondence](https://github.com/QinYang79/Noisy-Correspondence-Summary) (NC). Recently, I've been conducting research related to ***LLMs***.

- Multimodal Learning: Multimodal Fusion & Cross-modal Learning
- Noisy Correspondence: NCs in Image-Text Matching and Text-based ReID
- LLMs/MLLMs: [Code LLMs  & Application of MLLMs/LLMs](https://qinyang-cs.github.io/projects/LLMs).
- [**This**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XxH3dl3Oq7t8mDBrEaAHKykmLstVLi-MbfouroMYvY/edit?usp=sharing) is a Chinese brief to help MT recruit Research Interns (RI) about LLMs. If you are interested, please get in touch with me.
